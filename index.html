         <h3>The Cotton White Tee: Rising popularity of the white tee shirt</h3>Rising popularity of the white tee shirt
         The U.S Navy adopted the white cotton t-shirts as an undergarment for their uniforms
         in 1913. The U.S. Army followed suit and so did other manual laborer ocupations.
         It was until 1938 that the white tee shirt was advertised as outer wear. Sears called it the "Gob style"
         Gob was slang for sailors. picking up even more popularity and acceptance in the 1950s, the white shirts
         were seen on rebellious Hollywood characters of movies.
