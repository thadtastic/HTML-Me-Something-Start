            <h3>The bachelor undershirt</h3>
            <P>
               In 1904 the Cooper Underwear Company, later to be known as Jockey
               showcased their "bachelor undershirt". This product was a long sleeved undershirt
               advertised to be low maintenace with no need for saftey pins, needles, thread, and featuring no buttons

            <h3>The Cotton White Tee: Rising popularity of the white tee shirt</h3>
            <p id=testP>
               The U.S Navy adopted the white cotton t-shirts as an undergarment for their uniforms
               in 1913. The U.S. Army followed suit and so did other manual laborer ocupations.

         <h3> Making a Fashion Statement</h3>
         <p>
            It was until 1938 that the white tee shirt was advertised as outer wear. Sears called it the "Gob style"
            Gob was slang for sailors. picking up even more popularity and acceptance in the 1950s, the white shirts
            were seen on rebellious Hollywood characters of movies.

            <h3>The Graphic Tee</h3>

            <p class="funParagraph">
               the first graphic tees were seen in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.
               Its funny that back then all it took to make a costume for a minion was a graphic T- Shirt and a hat.
               Thomas Dewey used graphic tees in 1948 to promote his US presidential Candidacey
               Band t-shirts blessed the word with their presence in the 70s but it wasn't until the 90s until High
               fashion
               brands decided put t-shirts out
               Today t-shirts can make a fashion statements as well as political statements and good old hurmorous
               displays.
